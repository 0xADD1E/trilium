New features:
- what links here
  - link between encrypted notes could be done by encrypting note_ids of both sides of relations. Encryption must be
    deterministic to allow lookup by cipher text
- recent changes - links don't look like links (no underline, black)
- db upgrade / migration
- db backup into directory
- DONE: recent notes can either go to or add link
- might do the same thing with alt-j and alt-l
- ctrl-b nad linkem by mohlo byt goto do notu
- potencialne nova navigace back - forward
- javascript editor

Refactorings:
- modularize frontend
  - unify handling of global variables
- unify handling of dialogs and their forms - they all follow the same pattern - e.g. have one main dialog window/el

UI:
- need to represent global actions somehow - e.g. recent changes, settings
- better way how to represent per-note actions - what links here, encryption

Encryption:
- we don't have IV or encryption specific counter

Bugs:
- deleting cloned nodes ends with 500 (probably only on folders)
- Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on fancytree prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'getTree'
- FIXED: recent changes sorts 1st october to the end

Others:
- dates should be stored in UTC to work correctly with time zones
  - we should also record timezone info so that we display the date correctly with respect to the local date at the time of recording it
