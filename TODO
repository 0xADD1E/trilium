- pick new name for the project

New features:
- what links here
  - link between encrypted notes could be done by encrypting note_ids of both sides of relations. Encryption must be
    deterministic to allow lookup by cipher text
- recent changes - link to note should lead to the revision
- db upgrade / migration

Refactorings:
- modularize frontend
  - unify handling of global variables
- unify handling of dialogs and their forms - they all follow the same pattern - e.g. have one main dialog window/el

UI:
- need to represent global actions somehow - e.g. recent changes, settings
- better way how to represent per-note actions - what links here, encryption

Encryption:
- we don't have IV or encryption specific counter

Bugs:
- deleting cloned nodes ends with 500 (probably only on folders)

Others:
- dates should be stored in UTC to work correctly with time zones
  - we should also record timezone info so that we display the date correctly with respect to the local date at the time of recording it
